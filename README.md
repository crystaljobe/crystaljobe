## More about me:

It serves as a social media platform that facilitates the discovery, joining, and organization of social impact events and campaigns. Unlike traditional volunteer portals, ChangeMate integrates advanced features such as social media sharing, event collaboration, and a gamified challenge system to motivate participation and engagement.

I've been blessed enough to live in three different countries outside the US to include South Korea for a summer in college, Ireland to study abroad at the University of Limerick, and Australia to work abroad. My passions include helping others and attempting to make a positive change in the world around me, learning new things, and anything to do with animals!
